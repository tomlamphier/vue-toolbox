Completed all the topics under components--a long slog.  I seem to have settled into a way to write my topics that works for me.  

I make very rough notes on a folded piece of paper.  I don't mind balling up the paper and starting again (maybe more than once).  The rough notes can be cobbled together into a rough outline, and that I type into markdown documents.  Finally, I replace each section of outline with paragraphs.

I don't have a name for this technique.
