# Jsfiddle
Jsfiddle is a site for trying out javascript code in an environment that simulates a web browser, but without the associated overhead.  A fiddle is a small collection of code (ie a snippet) that is sufficient to test an idea or feature.  The site provides a way to include your dependencies with minimal fuss--a very useful capability.

The URl for jsfiddle is: [https://jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net).
## How to make a scratch project
Most of the time you create throwaway code when you are working on a fiddle.  The important thing is to see how something works, and you can 
save parts of it locally if you want to use them later.  You can save fiddles under your ID if you log on.  

The first thing you are likely to notice is a group of buttons that refer to different kinds of javascript packages, such as React, jquery, etc.  You can click on one of these to get a pre-built, working fiddle that you can adapt for your own uses.  The cloud icon toggles this header.

Selecting one of the types automatically pulls in the dependencies that it requires.  You can search/select additional dependencies off the left sidebar.  Just type in a name, and the sidebar will show matches which you can pick from.  This makes setting up a project's dependencies very easy.

## Working on a fiddle
The work screen has 4 panels: HTML, script, css, and output.  PF12 toggles console as a 5th panel below.  You usually start with a pre-filled example related to the type of fiddle, for example React. 
You can enter code in the panels and run it by clicking on the run icon (up top).  The code runs and sends the result to the output panel.

## Comments
I got best results when I didn't try to go beyond a simple case.  Jsfiddle is great as a scratchpad.  I saved a few fiddles, but I didn't go back to them. 

There is a temptation to try code out without thinking at all about what you're doing.  I find this is annoying; I need a clear idea of what I'm trying to do, otherwise I waste time.
