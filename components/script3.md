# Created Lifecycle Hook
There are 8 different lifecycle hooks.  The only one I have used so far is **created**.  I have a routine in vue311 to get a list of complaint types from the server, and this is done inside a created block.

created is just a function.  The syntax is:
```
created () {
   - - -   some init code   - - -
}
```
